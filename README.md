Spotify API ETL Project
This project utilizes AWS services (Lambda, Glue, CloudWatch, Athena, S3) to extract data from the Spotify API on a monthly basis. The extracted data includes information about albums, songs, and artists, which can be used for various purposes such as analysis, recommendation systems, or helps as a referrence to create new songs.

Project Components
AWS Lambda: Executes the data extraction process on a monthly basis.
AWS Glue: Optional component for data preparation and transformation.
Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors the execution of Lambda functions and overall system health.
Amazon Athena: Allows ad-hoc querying of the extracted data for analysis.
Amazon S3: Stores the raw and processed data extracted from the Spotify API.
Usage
Setting Up AWS Environment:

Create an AWS account if you haven't already.
Set up necessary IAM roles and permissions for Lambda, Glue, CloudWatch, Athena, and S3.
Configuration:

Configure the Lambda function to be triggered on a monthly basis using CloudWatch Events.
Set up environment variables or configuration files to store Spotify API credentials and other necessary parameters.
Data Extraction:

Lambda function makes requests to the Spotify API to extract data on albums, songs, and artists.
Retrieved data is stored in Amazon S3 in a structured format.
Data Preparation (Optional):

If needed, set up AWS Glue jobs to further process and transform the raw data stored in S3.
Data Analysis and Usage:

Clients can access the extracted data stored in S3 for analysis, recommendation systems, or creative purposes such as creating new songs.
Provide documentation on how to access and utilize the data stored in S3.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Monitor the execution of Lambda functions and other components using Amazon CloudWatch.
Handle any errors or issues that may arise during data extraction or processing.
